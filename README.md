# SOC_Estimation_EKF
Extended Kalman Filter based State of Charge (SOC) estimation which a model estimation method. It requires battery internal parameters like R0, R1,C1 which is obtained through EIS, HPPC test. The advantage of this method is that is adaptive in nature to error due to initial SOC, Noises (Process, measurement/sensor) which is not in Coulomb Counting.
